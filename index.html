        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresher</li>
            <p>First job which I got was of a Mechanical Supervisor and I worked there for an Year then I joined a fake IT company which shut down after 1.5 years after that I worked as a Supervisor for a construction company<br />And finally I worked as a technical support staff for a Govt. website. That was a contract job and My contract was for 1 year only. The behavior of my job was to clear the doubts of the public and if the issues caused are really serious then report it to the reporting officer.<br /> Since I did my job with utmost sincerity, the company extended my contract after each year. But the problem was the contractor company change each year which explains me not having a proper experience certificate.<br />So I am a fresher after all.</p>
